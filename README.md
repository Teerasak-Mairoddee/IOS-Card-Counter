# Black Jack Card Counter
An IOS mobile app that helps you decide bets based on what cards come out. This will give you a higher advantage.

# Features
1) 3 main buttons - Press for each card that gets dealt (including other players)
2) Utilises the MIT Strategy
3) Designed for GTA V's High Rollers Casino (4 Decks)
4) On screen instructions on how to bet.

# Why?
After learning about IOS apps via code academy, the curriculum required students to make our own project.
No guides were given and students had the freedom to make anything they wanted. At the time of this task,
my friends and I have been playing black jack in GTA. We've been testing all sorts of strategies and have been
loving seeing results pile in. With this in mind I developed a this app to help throw off the casino's advantage.
It was important that this was app-based so that I could use something that's easily accessible to everyone - a mobile phone. 
I chose IOS becuase I own an iphone and a macbook and saw the opportunity to create something that works within this ecosystem.
