# iOS Card Counter: Blackjack Strategy Assistant

This is a mobile iOS app designed to assist players in Blackjack by tracking cards and providing bet guidance based on statistical advantage. Built with the MIT counting strategy, it helps players maximise their edge during gameplay.

## What It Does

The app helps users keep track of dealt cards and offers betting suggestions to improve odds, especially during multi-deck Blackjack sessions like those found in GTA V's High Rollers Casino.

## Features

- Simple, intuitive interface with three primary buttons to track card values
- Real-time calculation based on the MIT counting strategy
- On-screen guidance for betting decisions
- Optimised for four-deck Blackjack games
- Designed specifically for use in GTA V's casino but applicable to other settings

## How It Works

As cards are dealt (including those shown by the dealer and other players), users tap corresponding buttons on-screen. The app updates a running count, helping the user determine whether to increase, decrease, or hold their bet.

## Why I Built This

While learning Swift and iOS development through Codecademy, I was assigned a free-form capstone project. At the time, my friends and I were playing Blackjack in GTA V and experimenting with various strategies. We wanted a lightweight way to apply real card counting principles during gameplay.

Building a mobile app was the most practical approach, ensuring quick access and portability. Since I use a MacBook and iPhone, iOS was the natural platform to develop on.

This project not only helped apply the programming concepts I had learned but also provided a fun and educational tool for casual casino gameplay.

## How to Use

1. Install on your iOS device via Xcode (or TestFlight if shared)
2. Tap the appropriate button for each card dealt
3. Follow on-screen betting advice
4. Reset the count when the deck is reshuffled

## Technologies Used

- Swift
